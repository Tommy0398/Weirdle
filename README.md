# Weirdle
Experimenting with using plots to make a wordle-like interface in an overly convoluted manner 

## Ideas
- Use plots as as the text display 
- Use buttons as a terribly made keyboard or just have text input 
- Create options for the number of letters for the word
- Make the browser remember inputs
